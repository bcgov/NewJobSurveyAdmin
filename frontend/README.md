# NewJobSurveyAdmin Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then converted to be built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project (`frontend`) directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies.

### `yarn build`

Using `vite`, builds the app for production to the `frontend\public` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
